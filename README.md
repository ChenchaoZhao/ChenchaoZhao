#### Medical Abstract
 > To explore the relationship between consumption of fish sauce and the risk of **gastric cancer [Pathological_formation]** in Fujian Province . An ecological study was carried out . A total of 11000 subjects from 55 townships were randomly selected from 10 counties within Fujian Province . All subjects were local residents who had been living in Fujian Province for more than 20 years , within the age group of 45 - 74 years . Trained interviewers conducted face - to - face interviews with a standardized questionnaire , which covered the frequency and amount of food intake , dietary habit , tobacco and alcohol consumption and history of chronic **gastric [Organ]** diseases . Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using Epi - info and SAS statistical packages , respectively . A significant correlation between monthly consumption of fish sauce and mortality of **gastric cancer [Pathological_formation]** was found . Pearson ' s coefficient of correlation was statistically significant with r = 0 .7356 for males , r = 0 . 5246 for females ( P < 0 . 01 ) . In the multivariate analysis , consumption of fish sauce still showed an association with the risk of gastric cancer [Pathological_formation] . No significant positive correlation between **esophagus cancer  [Pathological_formation]** , **liver cancer [Pathological_formation]** , **colon cancer [Pathological_formation]** and consumption of fish sauce were observed . Long - term intake of fish sauce may be related to high mortality of **gastric cancer [Pathological_formation]** . Consumption of fish sauce might be one of important and unique etiologic factors of **gastric cancer [Pathological_formation]** in Fujian Province . Further studies are needed to confirm this ecological study .
 
#### News

 > The battle took place in and around the demolished **ruins [Location]** of the **New Avengers Facility [Location]** in **New York [Location]** , shortly after it was destroyed by **Thanos [Person]** ' flagship , **the Sanctuary II [Organisation]** . After **the Avengers [Organisation]**, united under the banner of **Captain America [Person]** , rallied their own defenses in **the united Wakandan forces [Organisation]** , **the Masters of the Mystic Arts [Organisation]** , **the [Organisation] Ravagers [Organisation]** , **the Asgardians [Organisation]** , and **the Guardians of the Galaxy [Organisation]** , both sides then collided to a head in a massive assault , fighting for possession of the **Infinity Stones [Weapon]** . Many casualties from both battlefronts resulted from the battle .
