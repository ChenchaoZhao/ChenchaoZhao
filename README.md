## Project Highlights

* [TorchLiter](https://github.com/ChenchaoZhao/TorchLiter)
  * Customizable and light-weight neural network training toolbox
  * Built on PyTorch
  * Pronounced "Torch Lighter"
* [MNIST-Detection](https://github.com/ChenchaoZhao/mnist-detection)
  * Randomly scattered MNIST digits for quick detector experimentation
  * You can also use FashionMNIST or alike 
* [MasonJar](https://github.com/chenchao-clarifai/MasonJar)
  * Repo-free experiment containerization
  * Build, test, and push `Docker` images all in `Python`
  * Reuse experiement images through `Python` class inheritance
* [Mario](https://github.com/chenchao-clarifai/Mario)
  * `Kubeflow` is very much like `Tensorflow` (of course they share the last name)
  * `Mario` is the `Kera` or `PyTorch` of `Kubeflow`
  * Users can intuitively build pipelines without lengthy and confusing API bureaucracy
* [Varius](https://github.com/ChenchaoZhao/varius)
  * Perform calculations in various hypothetical scenarios with ease
  * Symbolic manipulations based on `Sympy`
  * Great tool for case study or back-of-envelope calculations
  * Almost pure `Python`, highly portable, even on mobile devices, calculation on the go
* Machine Learning Blog 
  * [Machine Learning Demystified](https://chenchao-zhao.gitbook.io/machine-learning-demystified/)
  * My scattered thoughts on ML
